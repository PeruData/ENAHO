These programs create a single dataset using raw files scrapped from INEI's webpage. The final product is a set of 21 ENAHO cross sections covering the 1997-2017 period. 

Downloading raw files, as well as setting up and maintaining an adequately structured directory, is up to the user. 

Only "data creator.do" should be directly executed.
