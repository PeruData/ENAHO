These programs create a single dataset using raw files scrapped from INEI's webpage. The final product is a dataset made up of 21 yearly ENAHO cross sections (1997-2017). 

Downloading raw files, as well as setting up and maintaining an adequately structured directory, is up to the user. Only "0_data creator.do" should be run directly.

Note: based on replication files for Aragon and Rud (Policy, 2013), published on the American Economics Association's official [website](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.5.2.1).
